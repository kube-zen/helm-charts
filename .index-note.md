# Index.yaml Note

⚠️ **Important**: The `index.yaml` file references .tgz files that are no longer committed to this repository.

Chart packages (.tgz files) are now excluded from git via `.gitignore`. The `index.yaml` file should be regenerated using:

```bash
helm repo index . --url https://kube-zen.github.io/helm-charts
```

This will create a new index.yaml based on the actual chart packages available in the repository (if any are built locally) or from the GitHub Pages deployment.

**Note**: Chart packages should be built and published to GitHub Pages, not committed to git.
